1:47
We begin on Christmas Eve with me, Mark, and my roommate, Roger.
1:52
We live in an industrial loft on the corner of 11th Street and Avenue B. It's the top floor of what was once a music-publishing factory.
2:01
Old rock 'n' roll posters hang on the walls. They have Roger's picture advertising gigs...
2:07
...at CBGB's and the Pyramid Club. We have an illegal wood-burning stove.
2:14
Its exhaust pipe crawls up to a skylight. All of our electrical appliances are plugged...
2:20
...into one thick extension cord which snakes its way out a window.
2:25
Outside, a small tent city has sprung up in the lot next to our building.
2:31
Inside, it's freezing because we have no heat. Smile!
2:38
December 24th, 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time From here on in, I shoot without a script
2:46
See if anything comes of it Instead of my old shit First shot Roger
2:52
Tuning the Fender guitar He hasn't played in a year -This won't tune -So we hear
2:57
He's just coming back From half a year of withdrawal -You talking to me? -Not at all
3:04
Are you ready? Hold that focus steady Tell the folks at home What you're doing, Roger
3:12
I'm writing one great-- -The phone rings -Saved Re-screen Zoom in on the answering machine
3:20
-Speak. -Speak. That was a very loud beep I don't even know if this is working
3:26
Mark? Mark? Are you there? Are you screening your calls? It's Mom We wanted to call And say we love you
3:33
And we'll miss you tomorrow Cindy and the kids are here Send their love Oh, I hope you like the hot plate
3:39
Just don't leave it on, dear When you leave the house Oh, and Mark We're sorry to hear That Maureen dumped you
3:46
I say c'est la vie So let her be a lesbian
3:53
There are other fishies in the sea Love, Mom Tell the folks at home What you're doing, Roger
4:00
-I'm writing one great song -The phone rings We screen
4:05
-Speak. -Speak. -Chestnuts roasting -Collins -I'm downstairs -Hey
4:11
Roger picked up the phone? -No, it's me -Throw down the key A wild night is now preordained
4:19
I may be detained What does he mean? What do you mean, detained?
4:27
-Benny. Shit. -Shit. -Dudes, I'm on my way -Great, fuck -I need the rent -What rent?
4:32
-This past year's rent, which I let slide. -Let slide? You said we were golden. -When you bought the building -When we were roommates
4:38
-Remember, you lived here? -How could I forget? You, me, Collins and Maureen.
4:44
How is the drama queen? She's performing tonight. I know. Still a production manager?
4:49
Two days ago, I was bumped. -You still dating her? -Last month, I was dumped
4:55
-She's in love -Oh, she's got a new man? -Well, no-- -What's his name? -Joanne. -Joanne.
5:02
Rent, my amigos, is due, or I will have to evict you. Be there in a few.
5:18
The power blows.
5:33
How do you document real life When real life's getting more Like fiction each day?
5:40
Headlines, bread lines Blow my mind And now this deadline Eviction or pay
5:48
Rent How do you write a song When the chords sound wrong?
5:53
Though they once sounded Right and rare When the notes are sour Where is the power
6:00
You once had to ignite the air? -We're hungry and frozen -Some life we've chosen
6:07
-How we gonna pay? -How we gonna pay? -How we gonna pay? -How we gonna pay?
6:12
-How we gonna pay -How we gonna pay -Last year's rent? -Last year's rent?
6:19
We light candles.
6:26
How do you start a fire When there's nothing to burn And it feels like something's stuck In your flue?
6:34
How can you generate heat When you can't feel your feet -And they're turning blue? -And they're turning blue?
6:40
You light up a mean blaze -With posters -And screenplays -How we gonna pay? -How we gonna pay?
6:46
-How we gonna pay? -How we gonna pay? -How we gonna pay -How we gonna pay
6:51
-Last year's rent? -Last year's rent? Don't screen, Maureen, it's me.
6:56
Joanne, your substitute production manager. Hey, hey, hey. Did you eat? Don't change the subject, Maureen
7:02
But, darling, You haven't eaten all day You won't throw up You won't throw up
7:08
The digital delay didn't blow up, exactly. There may have been one teeny, tiny spark.
7:13
You're not calling Mark. How do you stay on your feet When on every street It's trick or treat
7:20
And tonight it's trick? Welcome back to town I should lie down
7:26
Everything's brown And, uh-oh, I feel sick -Where is he? -Getting dizzy
7:33
-How we gonna pay? -How we gonna pay? How we gonna pay?
7:38
How we gonna pay Last year's rent?
7:56
Allison, baby You sound sad I can't believe those two After everything I've done
8:01
Ever since our wedding, I'm dirt They'll see I can help them all out In the long run
8:07
The music ignites the night -With passionate fire -Maureen, I'm not a theater person.
8:12
The narration crackles and pops With incendiary wit Could never be a theater person.
8:17
Zoom in as they burn the past To the ground And feel the heat Of the future's glow
8:23
Hello. Maureen. Your equipment won't work? Okay, all right, I'll go.
8:28
How do you leave the past behind When it keeps finding ways To get to your heart?
8:36
It reaches way down deep And tears you inside out Till you're torn apart Rent
8:43
How can you connect in an age Where strangers, landlords, lovers Your own blood cells betray?
8:50
What binds the fabric together When the raging, shifting winds Of change keep ripping away?
8:58
Draw a line in the sand And then make a stand -Use your camera to spar -Use your guitar
9:03
When they act tough You call their bluff We're not gonna pay
9:09
We're not gonna pay We're not gonna pay
9:14
Last year's rent This year's rent
9:19
Next year's rent Rent, rent, rent, rent, rent
9:25
We're not gonna pay rent 'Cause everything is rent
10:00
Christmas bells are ringing Christmas bells are ringing
10:07
Christmas bells are ringing Somewhere else, not here
10:26
You okay, honey? I'm afraid so They get any money?
10:33
No, had none to get But they purloined my coat
10:40
Well, you missed a sleeve
10:46
-Thanks -Hell, it's Christmas Eve I'm Angel
10:53
Angel Indeed.
11:01
An angel of the first degree Friends call me Collins. Tom Collins.
11:08
Nice tree Let's get a Band-Aid for your knee I'll change it
11:14
There's a Life Support meeting At 9:30 Yes, this body Provides a comfortable home
11:20
For the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome -As does mine -Oh, well, you look fine
11:26
Get you a coat Have a bite and make a night -I'm flush -My friends are waiting You're cute when you blush
11:33
The more, the merry Ho, ho, ho And I do not take no
11:44
-Where are you going? -Maureen calls. You're such a sucker.
11:50
I don't suppose you'd like to see her show in the lot tonight... ...or come to dinner?
11:55
Zoom in on my empty wallet. Touché. Take your AZT.
12:02
Close on Roger His girlfriend April left a note Saying, "We've got AIDS"
12:08
Before slitting her wrists In the bathroom I'll check up on you later.
12:14
If you change your mind.... You have to get out of the house.
12:23
I'm writing one great song Before I....
12:41
God.
12:57
One song Glory One song before I go
13:04
Glory One song to leave behind
13:10
Find one song One last refrain Glory From the pretty-boy front man
13:21
Who wasted opportunity
13:26
One song He had the world at his feet Glory In the eyes of a young girl
13:35
A young girl Find glory
13:41
Beyond the cheap colored lights One song Before the sun sets
13:46
Glory On another empty life
13:54
Time flies Time dies
14:03
Glory
14:09
One blaze of glory
14:16
One blaze of glory
14:23
Glory
14:31
Find glory In a song that rings true Truth like a blazing fire
14:39
An eternal flame Find one song
14:48
A song about love Glory From the soul of a young man
14:56
A young man Find the one song Before the virus takes hold
15:04
Glory Like a sunset One song To redeem this empty life
15:14
Time flies And then no need To endure anymore
15:22
Time dies
15:30
The door.
15:35
-What'd you forget? -Got a light? I know you, you're--
15:42
You're shivering It's nothing They turned off my heat And I'm just a little weak on my feet Would you light my candle?
15:56
-What are you staring at? -Nothing Your hair in the moonlight
16:03
You look familiar -Can you make it? -Just haven't eaten much today
16:11
At least the room Stopped spinning anyway -What? -Nothing
16:17
-Your smile reminded me of-- -I always "remind people of" -Who is she? -She died
16:24
-Her name was April -It's out again Sorry 'bout your friend Would you light my candle?
16:37
-Well? -Yeah? Oh, the wax
16:43
-It's-- -Dripping -I like it between my-- -Fingers
16:48
I figured Oh, well, good night
17:00
-It blew out again? -No, I think that I dropped my stash I know I've seen you out and about
17:08
When I used to go out Your candle's out I'm illin' I had it when I walked in the door
17:16
It was pure Is it on the floor? The floor?
17:21
They say that I have the best ass Below 14th Street -Is it true? -What?
17:28
-You're staring again -Oh, no I mean, you do have a nice--
17:34
I mean, you look familiar -Like your dead girlfriend -Only when you smile
17:39
But I'm sure I've seen you Somewhere else Do you go to the Cat Scratch Club? That's where I work
17:46
I dance Help me look Yes They used to tie you up It's a living
17:53
I didn't recognize you Without the handcuffs We could light the candle
18:03
Oh, won't you light the candle?
18:12
Why don't you forget that stuff? -You look like you're 16 -I'm 19
18:18
But I'm old for my age I'm just born to be bad I once was born to be bad I used to shiver like that
18:28
-I have no heat, I told you -I used to sweat -I got a cold -Uh-huh, I used to be a junkie
18:34
-But now and then I like to feel good -Uh-huh -Oh, here -What's that? Candy-bar wrapper.
18:41
We could light the candle
18:48
Oh, what'd you do to my candle?
18:57
-That was my last match -Our eyes'll adjust -Thank God for the moon -Maybe it's not the moon at all
19:06
I hear Spike Lee's shootin' Down the street Bah humbug
19:13
Bah humbug -Cold hands -Yours too
19:19
Big Like my father's Do you wanna dance?
19:25
With you? -No, with my father -I'm Roger
19:32
They call me They call me Mimi
19:52
Hi, you've reached Maureen and Joanne. Leave a message. Don't forget "Over the Moon," my performance...
19:57
...protesting the eviction of the homeless and artists... ...from the 11th Street lot tonight at midnight, between A and B.
20:03
Party at Life Cafe to follow. Well, Joanne, we're off I tried you at the office
20:09
And they said you were Stage managing or something Remind her that those unwed mothers in Harlem need her help too.
20:16
Call Daisy for our itinerary Or Alfred at Pound Ridge Or Eileen at the State Department In a pinch
20:21
We'll be at the spa for New Year's Unless the senator changes his mind -The hearings -Oh, yes, kitten
20:27
Mommy's confirmation hearings Begin on the 10th We'll need you alone By the 6th -Harold! -You hear that?
20:34
Just three weeks away And she's already nervous -I am not -For Mommy's sake, kitten No Doc Martens this time And wear a dress, oh, and Kitten
20:44
-Have a merry -And a bra
20:50
Enter Tom Collins. Computer genius, teacher, vagabond anarchist...
20:56
...who ran naked through the Parthenon.
21:02
Bustelo, Marlboro Banana by the bunch A box of Cap'n Crunch Will taste so good
21:10
-And firewood -Look, it's Santa Claus -Hold your applause -Oh, hi
21:17
-"Oh, hi," after seven months? -Sorry This boy could use some Stoli
21:22
Oh, holy night You struck gold at MIT
21:28
They expelled me for my theory of actual reality... ...which I'll soon impart to the couch potatoes at New York University.
21:36
-Still haven't left the house? -I was waiting for you, don't you know? Well, tonight's the night. Come to the Life Cafe after Maureen's show.
21:43
No flow. Gentlemen, our benefactor On this Christmas Eve Whose charity is only matched By talent, I believe
21:52
A new member of the Alphabet City Avant-garde Angel Dumott Schunard
22:14
Today for you Tomorrow for me
22:20
Today for you Tomorrow for me -And you should hear her beat -You earned this on the street?
22:27
It was my lucky day today On Avenue A When a lady in a limousine Drove my way
22:34
She said, "Darling, be a dear Haven't slept in a year I need your help to make my Neighbor's yappy dog disappear
22:42
This Akita, Evita, just won't shut up I believe if you play nonstop
22:48
That pup will breathe its very last High-strung breath I'm certain that cur Will bark itself to death"
22:57
Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you Tomorrow for me
23:04
We agreed on a fee $1000 guarantee, tax free And a bonus if I trim her tree
23:11
Now, who could foretell That it would go so well? But sure as I am here That dog is now in doggy hell
23:18
After an hour, Evita, in all her glory From a window ledge Of that 23rd story
23:26
Like Thelma and Louise did When they got the blues Swan-dove into the courtyard Of the Gracie Mews
23:33
Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you Tomorrow for me
23:45
You go, girl.
23:55
Back on the street Where I met my sweet Where he was moaning and groaning On the cold concrete
24:02
The nurse took him home For some Mercurochrome Then I dressed his wounds And got him back on his feet
24:09
Sing it Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you Tomorrow for me
24:16
I said Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you
24:22
Tomorrow
24:27
For me
24:35
Joy to the world Hey. You bum. Yeah, you. Move over.
24:40
Get your ass off that Range Rover. That attitude toward the homeless... ...is exactly what Maureen is protesting tonight.
24:48
Close-up: Our ex-roommate, Benjamin Coffin III.... ...who married Allison Grey of the Westport Greys...
24:54
...then bought our building and the lot next door... ...from his father-in-law, in hopes of starting a cyber-studio.
25:00
Maureen is protesting Losing her performance space Not my attitude
25:08
What happened to Benny? What happened to his heart And the ideals he once pursued?
25:17
Any owner of that lot next door Has the right to do with it As he pleases
25:24
Happy birthday, Jesus -The rent -You're wasting your time -We're broke -You broke your word, this is absurd
25:30
There is one way You won't have to pay I knew it. Next door, the home of CyberArts
25:36
And now that the block is rezoned Our dream can become a reality
25:42
You'll see, boys You'll see, boys
25:51
A state-of-the-art, digital Virtual interactive studio I'll forgo your rent And on paper guarantee
25:59
That you can stay here for free -If you do me one small favor. -What? Convince Maureen to cancel her protest.
26:06
Why not just get an injunction or call the cops? I did, and they're on standby.
26:11
But my investors would rather I handle this quietly You can't wipe out an entire tent city...
26:18
...then watch It's a Wonderful Life on TV. You wanna produce films and write songs? You need somewhere to do it
26:24
It's what we used to dream about Think twice before you pooh-pooh it You'll see, boys
26:32
You'll see, boys You'll see the beauty of a studio
26:40
That lets us do our work And get paid With condos on the top Whose rent keeps open our shop
26:49
Just stop the protest And you'll have it made You'll see
26:55
Or you'll pack. That boy could use some Prozac. -Or heavy drugs. -Or group hugs.
27:00
Which reminds me, we have a detour to make tonight. Anyone who wants to can come along.
27:06
Life Support's a group for people coping with life. We don't have to stay too long. First I've got a protest to save
27:12
-Pleasure. -I'm not much company. -Behave. -He'll catch up later. He's just got other things on his mind.
27:18
We'll see, boys We'll see, boys
27:26
Let it be, boys -I like boys -Boys like me
27:34
We'll see
27:42
And so, into the abyss The lot, where a small stage is partially set up.
27:48
Line in. I went to Harvard for this? -Close on Mark's nose dive. -Line out. Will he get out of here alive?
27:56
-Mark? -Hi. I told her not to call you That's Maureen, but can I help Since I'm here?
28:05
I've hired an engineer. Great.
28:11
So nice to have met you. Wait.
28:16
She's three hours late.
28:22
The samples won't delay But the cable-- There's another way Say something, anything
28:28
Test, one, two, three Anything but that
28:35
-This is weird -It's weird -Very weird -Fuckin' weird I'm so mad that I don't know what to do
28:42
Fighting with microphones Freezing down to my bones And to top it all off I'm with you
28:50
Feel like going insane? Got a fire in your brain? And you're thinking Of drinking gasoline?
28:57
-As a matter of fact -Honey, I know this act It's called the Tango: Maureen
29:05
The Tango: Maureen It's a dark, dizzy merry-go-round
29:12
-As she keeps you dangling -You're wrong -Your heart she is mangling -It's different with me
29:20
And you toss and you turn 'Cause her cold eyes can burn Yet you yearn, and you churn And rebound
29:27
I think I know what you mean -The Tango: Maureen -The Tango: Maureen
29:35
Has she ever pouted her lips And called you "pookie"?
29:41
Never. Have you ever Doubted a kiss or two?
29:46
This is spooky Did you swoon When she walked through the door?
29:53
Every time, so be cautious Did she moon over other boys?
30:00
-More than moon -I'm getting nauseous
30:33
Where'd you learn how to tango? With the French ambassador's daughter in her room at Miss Porter's.
30:39
And you? With Nanette Himmelfarb, the rabbi's daughter... ...at the Scarsdale Jewish Community Center.
30:47
It's hard to do this backwards. You should try it in heels. -She cheated -She cheated
30:53
-Maureen cheated -Fuckin' cheated I'm defeated I should give up right now
30:59
Gotta look on the bright side With all of your might I'd fall for her still, anyhow
31:06
When you're dancing her dance You don't stand a chance Her grip of romance makes you fall
31:14
-So you think, "Might as well" -"Dance a tango to hell" "At least I'll have tangoed at all"
31:21
The Tango: Maureen Gotta dance till your diva is through
31:29
You pretend to believe her 'Cause in the end You can't leave her
31:37
But the end, it will come Still you have to play dumb Till you're glum and you bum And turn blue
31:44
Why do we love when she's mean? And she can be so obscene
31:51
Try the mike. My Maureen -Patched. -Thanks.
31:58
You know, I feel great now. I feel lousy.
32:09
Hey, honey. We're-- "Pookie"? You never called me "Pookie."
32:19
Forget it. We're patched. The Tango: Maureen
32:42
Steve. Gordon. Ali. -Pam. -Lisa.
32:48
Hi. I'm Angel. Tom. Collins. I'm Paul. Let's begin.
32:56
There's only us There's only this
33:04
Sorry. Excuse me. And you are...? Oh, I'm not-- I'm just here-- I don't have-- I'm here with....
33:12
Mark Mark I'm Mark. Well, this is quite an operation
33:20
Sit down, Mark. We'll continue the affirmation. Forget regret
33:28
Or life is yours to miss Excuse me, Paul I'm having a problem with this
33:34
This credo My T-cells are low. I regret that news, okay?
33:39
All right, but, Gordon How do you feel today? -What do you mean? -How do you feel today?
33:45
-Okay. -Is that all? -Best I've felt all year -Then why choose fear?
33:50
I'm a New Yorker Fear's my life
33:56
Look, I find Some of what you teach suspect Because I'm used to Relying on intellect
34:04
But I try to open up To what I don't know Because reason says I should have died
34:12
Three years ago No other road
34:20
No other way No day but today
34:41
What's the time? Well, it's gotta be close to midnight
34:47
My body's talking to me It says, "Time for danger"
34:53
It says, "I wanna commit a crime Wanna be the cause of a fight
35:00
I wanna put on a tight skirt And flirt with a stranger"
35:08
I've had a knack from way back At breaking the rules Once I learn the game
35:14
Get up, life's too quick I know someplace sick Where this chick'll Dance in the flames
35:21
We don't need any money I always get in for free
35:28
You can get in too If you get in with me
35:33
Let's go Out tonight
35:41
I have to go Out tonight
35:49
You wanna play? Let's run away We won't be back Before it's Christmas Day
35:56
Take me out tonight Meow.
36:07
Yeah When I get a wink From the doorman
36:13
Do you know how lucky you'll be? That you're on the line With the feline of Avenue B
36:22
Let's go Out tonight
36:28
I have to go Out tonight
36:36
You wanna prowl? Be my night owl? Well, take my hand, we're gonna
36:42
Howl Out tonight
36:50
In the evening I gotta roam Can't sleep in the city Of neon and chrome
36:57
Feels too damn much like home When the Spanish babies cry
37:05
So let's find a bar So dark we forget who we are
37:11
Where all the scars From the nevers and maybes die
37:17
Let's go Out tonight
37:24
I have to go Out tonight
37:33
You're sweet Wanna hit the street? Wanna wail at the moon Like a cat in heat?
37:39
Just take me Out tonight
37:45
Please take me Out tonight
37:52
Don't forsake me Out tonight
37:58
I'll let you make me Out tonight
38:05
Tonight Tonight Tonight
38:21
Who do you think you are? Barging in on me and my guitar
38:27
Little girl, hey, the door is that way You better go You know the fire's out anyway
38:34
Take your powder Take your candle Your sweet whisper I just can't handle
38:40
Well, take your hair In the moonlight Your brown eyes Goodbye, good night
38:49
I should tell you I should tell you I should tell you, I should-- No
38:54
Another time, another place Our temperature would climb There'd be a long embrace
39:00
We'd do another dance It'd be another play Looking for romance? Come back another day
39:09
Another day The heart may freeze
39:16
Or it can burn The pain will ease
39:23
If I can learn There is no future
39:29
There is no past I live this moment as
39:35
My last There's only us
39:42
There's only this Forget regret
39:49
Or life is yours to miss No other road
39:55
No other way No day but today
40:04
Excuse me if I'm off track But if you're so wise Then tell me Why do you need smack?
40:10
Take your needle Take your fancy prayer Don't forget Get the moonlight out of your hair
40:17
Long ago you might have Lit up my heart But the fire's dead Ain't never ever gonna start

59:35
And it's beginning to And it's beginning to And it's beginning to
59:50
Joanne? Which way to the stage? Snow
1:00:08
Maureen's performance. Last night I had a dream.
1:00:15
I found myself in a desert called Cyberland. It was hot.
1:00:21
My canteen had sprung a leak, and I was... ...thirsty. Out of the abyss walked a cow.
1:00:28
Elsie. I asked if she had anything to drink. She said:
1:00:34
"I'm forbidden to produce milk
1:00:40
In Cyberland we only drink Diet Coke"
1:00:47
Yes. She said: "Only thing to do
1:00:54
Is jump over the moon They've closed everything real down Like barns and troughs
1:01:04
And performance spaces
1:01:11
And replaced it all with lies And rules and virtual life"
1:01:21
But there is a way out. Leap of faith, leap of faith Leap of faith, leap of faith
1:01:29
Only thing to do Is jump over the moon
1:01:37
I gotta get out of here It's like I'm being tied to the hood Of a yellow rental truck
1:01:45
Packed in With fertilizer and fuel oil Pushed over a cliff By a suicidal Mickey Mouse
1:01:53
I've Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
1:01:58
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta Gotta, gotta find a way
1:02:05
To jump over the moon Only thing to do Is jump over the moon
1:02:16
Then a little bulldog entered. His name, we have learned, was Benny.
1:02:21
And although he once had principles... ...he abandoned them to live as a lapdog... ...to a wealthy daughter of the revolution.
1:02:28
A one, two, three "That's bull," Benny said "Ever since the cat took up the fiddle That cow's been jumpy
1:02:38
The dish and the spoon were evicted From the table and eloped She's had trouble with her milk And the moon ever since
1:02:45
Maybe it's a female thing 'Cause who'd wanna leave Cyberland anyway?
1:02:53
Walls ain't so bad The dish and the spoon, for instance They're down on their luck They come knockin' On my doghouse door
1:03:00
And I said 'Not in my backyard, utensils.
1:03:05
Go back to China"' "The only way out is up" Elsie whispered to me
1:03:16
"A leap Of faith"
1:03:26
"Still thirsty?" "Parched."
1:03:32
"Have some milk." And I lowered myself beneath her swollen udder...
1:03:38
...and sucked the sweetest milk I had ever tasted.
1:03:44
"Climb onboard," she said And as a harvest moon rose over Cyberland...
1:03:51
...we reared back, we sprang into a gallop... ...leaping out of orbit. I awoke, singing....
1:03:59
Singing. Shit.
1:04:05
Leap of faith Leap of faith Leap of faith Leap of faith
1:04:11
Only thing to do Only thing to do is jump
1:04:17
Only thing to do is Jump over the moon
1:04:23
Only thing to do is Jump over the moon
1:04:29
Over the moon Over the....
1:04:48

1:06:04
I would like to propose a toast to Maureen's noble try.
1:06:10
-It went well. -Go to hell. Was the yuppie scum stomped? Not counting the homeless, how many tickets weren't comped?
1:06:17
-Why did Muffy-- -Allison. --miss the show? There was a death in the family if you must know.
1:06:23

Mimi came to see me She had much to say That's not how you put it At all yesterday I couldn't stop thinking About the whole mess
1:36:41
-Mark, you'd wanna get this on film. -I guess. I regret the unlucky circumstances Of the past seven days

-That I hand you this key -Golf claps -I had no juice in my battery -Reshoot Oh, I see This is a photo opportunity

The benevolent god ushers the poor artists back to their flat. Planning on taking the barbed wire from the lot?
1:37:08
-Anything but that -Clearing the lot was a safety concern We break ground this month But you can return
1:37:13
That's why you're here With people you hate Instead of with Muffy At Muffy's estate I'd honestly rather be with you tonight Than in Westport
1:37:20
-Spare us, sport, the sound bite. -Mimi, since you're so seductive Persuade him not to be So counterproductive
1:37:26
-Tell them what you wore to my place -I was on my way to work Black leather and lace My desk was a mess, I'm still sore
1:37:32
I kicked him And told him I wasn't his whore Your boyfriend know Who your last boyfriend was? I'm not her boyfriend. I don't care what she does.
1:37:39
People, is this any way to start A new year? Have compassion -Benny just lost his cat -My dog, but I appreciate that

-To dogs -No, Benny, to you! -Let's make a resolution -I'll drink to that
1:38:00
Let's always stay friends -Though we may have our disputes -This family tree's got deep roots
1:38:07
-Friendship is thicker than blood -That depends -Depends on trust -It depends on true devotion
1:38:15
-Depends on love -Depends on not denying emotion Perhaps.
1:38:21
-It's gonna be a happy new year -I guess It's gonna be a happy new year
1:38:28
-You're right -It's gonna be a happy new year

Roger's down at Mimi's, where he's been for almost two months now. Although, he keeps talking about selling his guitar...
1:39:17
...and heading out of town. Still jealous of Benny. God knows where Collins and Angel are.
1:39:23
Could be that new shantytown near the river or a suite at the Plaza.
1:39:28
Maureen and Joanne are rehearsing. -I said, once more from the top! -I said, no!
1:39:33
That is, if they're speaking this week. Me? I'm here.
1:39:39
Nowhere. The line is, "CyberArts and its corporate sponsor... ...Grey Communications, wish to mitigate the Christmas Eve riots."
1:39:47
-What is so difficult about that? -It just doesn't roll off my tongue. I like my version.
1:39:52
You, dressed as a groundhog to protest the groundbreaking? -It's a metaphor. -It's less than brilliant.
1:39:59
-That's it, Miss Ivy League. -What? Ever since New Year's, I haven't said boo. I let you direct.
1:40:05
Didn't pierce my nipples because it grossed you out. I didn't dance that night because you wanted to go home.
1:40:10
You were flirting with the woman in rubber!
1:40:16
That's what this is about? There will always be women in rubber flirting with me. Give me a break.

1:52:56
Angel was one of my closest friends. It's right that it's Halloween because it was her favorite holiday.
1:53:05
I knew we'd hit it off the moment we met. That skinhead was bothering her... ...and she said she was more of a man than he'd ever be...
1:53:13
...and more of a woman than he'd ever get. And then there was a time...
1:53:19
...he walked up to this group of tourists... ...and they were petrified...
1:53:24
...because, A, they were obviously lost... ...and, B, had probably never spoken to a drag queen before in their lives.
1:53:32
And he.... She... ...just offered to escort them out of Alphabet City...
1:53:40
...and then she let them take a picture with her... ...and then she said she'd help them find the Circle Line.
1:53:48
So much more original than any of us. You'd find an old tablecloth on the street and make a dress...
1:53:56
...and next year, sure enough... ...they'd be mass-producing them at the Gap.
1:54:03
You always said how lucky you were that we were all friends...
1:54:08
...but it was us, baby... ...who were the lucky ones.
1:54:19
Live in my house
1:54:25

Open your door I'll be your tenant
1:55:09
Don't got much baggage To lay at your feet
1:55:15
But sweet kisses I've got to spare I'll be there and I'll cover you
1:55:29
I think they meant it When they said you can't buy love
1:55:34
Now I know you can rent it A new lease you are, my love
1:55:41
On life All my life
1:55:52
I've longed to discover Something as true as this is

Hi, it's Mark Cohen. Is Alexi there? No need to bother her.
1:57:37
Just let her know I'm running a little late for my appointment. I'm at my....
1:57:43
Yes, I'll still be there. Yes, I signed the contract.
1:57:50
Thanks.
1:57:55
How did we get here? How the hell? Pan left Close on the steeple of the church
1:58:06
How did I get here? How the hell? Christmas Christmas Eve last year
1:58:17
How could a night so frozen Be so scalding hot?
1:58:22
How can a morning this mild Be so raw?
1:58:28
Why are entire years strewn On the cutting-room floor of memory
1:58:34
When single frames From one magic night Forever flicker in close-up
1:58:39
On the 3-D Imax of my mind? That's poetic That's pathetic
1:58:48
Why did Mimi knock on Roger's door And Collins choose that phone booth
1:58:53
Back where Angel set up his drums? Why did Maureen's equipment Break down?
1:58:59
Why am I the witness? And when I capture it on film Will it mean that it's the end
1:59:07
And I'm alone?
1:59:17
It's true you sold your guitar And bought a car? It's true I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
1:59:26
It's true you're with This yuppie scum? You said you'd never Speak to him again
1:59:34
-Not now -Who said that you have any say -In who she says things to at all? -Yeah.
1:59:41
Who said that you should stick Your nose in other people--? Who said I was talking to you?
1:59:46
-We used to have this fight each night -Calm down -She'd never admit I existed -Everyone, please
1:59:52
He was the same way He was always Run away, hit the road, don't commit You're full of shit -She's in denial -He's in denial
2:00:00
Didn't give an inch When I gave a mile -I gave a mile -Gave a mile to who?
2:00:06
-Don't you dare come at me. -Come on, guys, chill. I'd be happy to die For a taste of what Angel had
2:00:13
-Someone to live for -Someone to live for -Unafraid to say, "I love you" -Unafraid to say, "I love you"
2:00:19
All your words are nice, Mimi But love's not a three-way street
2:00:25
You'll never share real love Until you love yourself I should know
2:00:30
You all said you'd be cool today So please, for my sake
2:00:39
I can't believe he's gone I can't believe you're going
2:00:45
I can't believe this family must die Angel helped us believe in love
2:00:52
I can't believe you disagree I can't believe this is
2:01:03
Goodbye
2:01:09
-Pookie. -Honey bear. -I missed you so much. -I missed you. -I missed your smell. -I missed your mouth.
2:01:18
-What? -Nothing, Pookie. No. No, baby, you said, "Ow." What is it? You bit my tongue.
2:01:24
-No, I didn't. -Yes. It's bleeding. I think I should know. -Let me see. I was just try-- -She doesn't believe me.
2:01:37
Thomas B. Collins? Coming.
2:01:56
I hear there are great restaurants Out West Some of the best How could she?
2:02:02
How could you let her go? You just don't know How could we lose Angel?
2:02:09
Maybe you'll see why When you stop escaping your pain At least now if you try Angel's death won't be in vain
2:02:20
His death is in vain
2:02:25
Are you insane? There's so much to care about There's me, there's Mimi
2:02:31
Mimi's got her baggage too So do you Who are you to tell me What I know and what to do?
2:02:38
-A friend -But who, Mark, are you?
2:02:45
"Mark has got his work" They say, "Mark lives for his work" And, "Mark's in love with his work"
2:02:52
-Mark hides in his work -From what? From facing your failure Facing your loneliness
2:03:00
Facing the fact you live a lie
2:03:06
Yes, you live a lie Tell you why You're always preaching Not to be numb
2:03:13
When that's how you thrive You pretend to create and observe When you really detach From feeling alive
2:03:21
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive
2:03:26
Poor baby!
2:03:32
Mimi still loves Roger Is Roger really jealous Or afraid that Mimi's weak?
2:03:40
Mimi did look pale Mimi's gotten thin Mimi's running out of time Roger's running out the door
2:03:48
No more Oh, no, I gotta go
2:03:54
Hey, for someone Who's always been let down Who's heading out of town?
2:04:00
For someone who longs For a community of his own Who's with his camera, alone?
2:04:09
I'll call I hate the fall
2:04:18
You heard? Every word
2:04:30
You don't want baggage Without lifetime guarantees
2:04:35
You don't want to watch me die I just came to say
2:04:41
Goodbye, love Goodbye, love Came to say goodbye, love Goodbye
2:04:51
Just came to say -Goodbye, love -Glory -Goodbye, love -One blaze of glory
2:04:58
Came to say goodbye, love -Goodbye -I have to find
2:05:09
Please don't touch me Understand I'm scared I need to go away
2:05:15
-I know a place, a clinic -A rehab? Maybe Could you? I'll pay
2:05:20
Goodbye, love Goodbye, love
2:05:26

2:12:34
I found my song He found his song If he could just find Mimi I tried. You know I tried.
2:12:41
Fade in on Mark Who's still in the dark -But he's got great footage -Which he's cut together
2:12:48
To screen tonight. -In honor of Benny's wife -Muffy Allison
2:12:53
Pulling Benny Out of the East Village location Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight.
2:13:02
I wonder how Allison found out about Mimi? Maybe a little bird told her. Or an angel.
2:13:09
I had a little hunch That you could use a little flow -Tutoring again? -Negative
2:13:16
-Back at NYU? -No, no, no I rewired the ATM At The Food Emporium
2:13:22
To provide an honorarium To anyone with the code The code
2:13:33
-Well? -Well? A-N-G-E-L.

Let's open up a restaurant In Santa Fe With a private corner banquette In the back

Mark! Roger! Anyone, help!
2:14:35
-Maureen? -It's Mimi! We can't get her up the stairs!
2:14:40
No!
2:14:47
She was huddled in the park In the dark And she was freezing And begged to come here
2:14:56
-Over here? Oh, God. -Yeah. Got a light? I know you You're shivering
2:15:03
-She's been living on the street -We need some heat -I'm shivering. -Okay.
2:15:09
We can buy some wood And something to eat I'm afraid she needs more than heat
2:15:17
I heard that Collins will call for a doctor, honey
2:15:24
Don't waste your money on me Hello, 911? I'm on hold.
2:15:31
Cold, cold Would you light my candle?
2:15:37
Yes-- Oh, God Find a candle
2:15:46
I should tell you I should tell you I should tell you I should tell you
2:15:54
I should tell you Benny wasn't anything--
2:15:59
I know I should tell you why I left

-It wasn't 'cause I didn't-- -I know -I should tell you -I should tell you
2:16:13
I should tell you, I love you
2:16:31
Who do you think you are? Leaving me alone with my guitar
2:16:39
Hold on, there's something You should hear It isn't much, but it took all year
2:16:56
Your eyes As we said our goodbyes
2:17:05
Can't get them out of my mind And I find
2:17:11
I can't hide
2:17:16
From your eyes The ones that took me by surprise
2:17:25
The night you came into my life Where there's moonlight
2:17:32
I see your eyes
2:17:37
How'd I let you slip away When I'm longing so to hold you?
2:17:47
Now I'd die for one more day 'Cause there's something I should have told you
2:17:56
Yes, there's something I should have told you
2:18:02
When I looked into your eyes Why does distance make us wise?
2:18:11
You were the song all along And before this song dies
2:18:23
I should tell you I should tell you I have always loved you
2:18:33
You can see it in my eyes
2:18:53
Mimi
2:19:21
-I jumped over the moon. -What? A leap of:
2:19:26
She's back. I was in a tunnel... ...headed for this warm, white light.
2:19:33
Oh, my God. And I swear... ...Angel was there.
2:19:39
And she looked good. And she said:
2:19:45
"Turn around, girlfriend... ...and listen to that boy's song."
2:19:51
She's drenched. Her fever's breaking
2:19:56
There is no future There is no past
2:20:05
Thank God this moment's Not the last
2:20:12
-There's only us -There's only us -There's only this -There's only this

-I can't control -Will I lose my dignity?
2:20:43
-My destiny -Will someone care?
2:20:50
-I trust my soul -Will I wake tomorrow My only goal
2:20:56
-Is just to be -From this nightmare?
2:21:02
-Without you -There's only now -The hand gropes -There's only here
2:21:08
-The ear hears -Give in to love -The pulse beats -Or live in fear
2:21:14
-Life goes on -No other path -But I'm gone -No other way
