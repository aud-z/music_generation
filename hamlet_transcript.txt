5:12
piece of him welcome Horatio welcome good Marcellus what is this thing appeared again tonight I have
5:19
seen nothing Horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded site
5:25
twice seen of us therefore I have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this knife but if again this
5:31
apparition comes he may approve our eyes and speak to us touch touch will not appear sit down a while let us once
5:38
again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story which we have to night scene last night of all
5:45
when yon same star that's westward from the Pollard made his course to a loom that's part of heaven where now it burns
5:51
Marcellus to myself the Bell then beating one piece break me off o see
5:56
where it comes again in the same image like the king that's dead if our two scholars speak to it Horatio looks it
6:02
not like the king market ratio most like it harrows me with fear and wondered would be spoke too big to a ratio what
6:10
art thou that you searched this time of night together with that fair and
6:18
warlike form in which the majesty of buried Denmark did sometimes march by
6:24
heaven I charge thee speak it is a fantasy it stalks away be speak
6:31
stay and speak is gone and will not answer how now Horatio you tremble and
6:42
look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you on its before my god I might not believe it
6:48
were not for the true and sensible about you of mine own eyes is it not like the king is thou art to thyself such with
6:55
the very Armour he had on when he the ambitious Norway combated tis strange in
7:00
the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that
7:06
knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land who wish that can
7:14
inform me that cannot at least the whisper goes so our last king whose
7:22
image even now appeared before us was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway dared
7:28
to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet's did slay this Fortinbras who by
7:33
a sealed compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life
7:38
all those his lands which he stood seized up to the Conqueror now sir young
7:44
Fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of Norway here
7:49
and there sharked up a list of lawless Resolute's to recover of us those for said lands so
7:56
by his father lost and this I take it is the source of this our watch butts off
8:04
whoa whoa when it comes again I'll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if
8:12
thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing
8:21
to be done than made to thee to ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art
8:28
privy to thy country's fate which happily foreknowing may avoid Oh speak
8:33
or if thou has supported in my life extorted treasures in the womb of earth for which they say new spirits off
8:40
walking death speak of it stay and speak
8:47
stop it Marcellus shall I strike at it with my parties heaven will not stand there what's his there she's gone and
8:59
will not answer we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it this show of
9:06
violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak
9:12
when the crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful
9:18
summons but look the morn and russet
9:24
mantle clad walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we up our watch and let us impart what we have seen
9:31
tonight unto young Hamlet for upon my life the spirit dumb to us will speak to
9:36
him [Music]

11:34
imperial joint rest to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping

lasting the perfume and suppliants of a minute no more no more it no more
22:31
perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cottle death besmirched the virtue of his will but you must fear his

22:51
safety and health of this whole state then weigh what loss your honor may

Lord I'm now a failure what's the matter the Lord I had been so frightened
41:35
with what milord as I was sewing in my closet Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced
41:41
pelas his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been lucid Out of
41:48
Hell to speak of Horrors he comes before me mad for thy love the Lord I do not
41:53
know but truly I do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard
42:00
then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand masoor his brow he falls to such perusal of my face
42:07
as though he would draw it long stayed he so at last a little shaking of mine
42:13
arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and
42:19
profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he
42:24
lets me go and with his head or his shoulder turned he seemed to make his
42:29
way without his eyes for outer doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me what have you
42:35
given him any hard words of late no milord but as you did command I did repel his letters and to deny his access
42:41
to me that hath made him mad come go II to the King this must be
42:47
known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love come
42:56
[Music]
43:21
welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern moreover that we much did
43:27
long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of Hamlet's
43:33
transformation what it should be more than his father's death I cannot dream of I entreat you both that you vouchsafe
43:39
your rest here in our Court some little time so by your companies to draw him onto pleasures and to gather so much is
43:46
from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open lies within our remedy good
43:52
gentleman he hath much talked of you and sure I am two men there are not living
43:59
to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and goodwill as to expend your time with us
44:06
here awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive
44:12
such thanks as fits a king's remembrance well both your Majesties might by the
44:17
sovereign powers you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty but we both obey and here give up
44:24
ourselves in the fool bent to lay our services freely at your feet to be commanded thanks Rosencrantz and gentle
44:31
Guildenstern thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz and I beseech you
44:39

rebuke and makes vow before his uncle Nevermore to give the assay of arms
45:06
against your majesty we're in old Norway overcome with joy gives him three
45:12
thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so
45:19
levied before against the with an entreaty herein further shown that it
45:25
might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and
45:31
allowance as therein are set down it likes as well and I do think that I have
45:38
found the very cause of Hamlet's lunacy I doubt it is no other but the main his
45:43
father's death and our or hasty marriage mallesh and Madam to expostulate what
45:51
Majesty should be what Duty is why day is day night night and time is time were
45:58
nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of
46:04
wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes I will be brief your
46:12
noble son is mad mad call I it for to
46:17
define true madness what is but be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam I swear
46:26
I use no art at all but he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis
46:34
true mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of
46:40
this effect or rather say the cause of this defect perpend I have a daughter have well she
46:49
is mine who in her duty and obedience have given me this now gather and
46:55
surmise to the celestial and my soul's Idol the
47:05
most beautified Ophelia that's an ill phrase a vile phrase beatified is a vile
47:11
phrase but you shall hear came this from Hamlet to her good madam stay awhile I
47:19
will be faithful doubt thou the stars
47:26
are fire doubt that the Sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt
47:37
I love no I feel eeeh I have not art to
47:43
reckon my groans but that I love the best who most best believe it at you die
47:50
Nevermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him Hamlet but how has she
47:56
received his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable I
48:04
would fain prove so but what might you think or my Majesty your dear Queen here
48:11
think if I had looked upon this love with idle sight no I went round to work
48:18
and my young mistress thus I did bespeak Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy sight
48:24
this must not be and he repulsed a short tale to make
48:30
fell into a sadness then to a fast thence to a watch things to a weakness
48:36
thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now
48:42
he raves and all we mourn for do you think tis this it may be very like has
48:48
there been such a time I'd say no that that I have positively said too so when
48:53
it proved otherwise not that I know take this from this if this be otherwise but
48:59
look we're sadly the poor wretch comes reading away I do beseech you both away I'll board him presently uh give me
49:07
leave
49:13
how does my good Lord Hamlet well do you
49:22
know me my lord excellent Vell you are a fish manga not
49:33
I'm a lord that I would you were so honest a man honest milord
49:39

49:45
thousands that's very true the Lord if the Sun breed maggots in a dead dog carrion have
50:00
you a daughter I have milord let her not walk in the Sun conception is a blessing but as your

50:55
satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards that their faces are
51:02
wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and Plumtree gum but they have a
51:08
plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though I most powerfully and potently
51:16
believed I hope it's not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir should
51:24
grow old as I am if like a crab you could go backward though this be madness
51:33
yet there is method in it will you walk out of the air milord into my grave
51:40

52:02

54:38
this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but
54:45

noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how Express and admirable in action how like an
54:58
angel in action apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and

in your memory begin at this lawn let me see let me see the rugged Pyrrhus like the hurricane
58:13
e'en beast is not so it begins with Pyrrhus the rugged Pyrrhus sable are the
58:25
rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble
58:32
when he captured in the ominous Horace hath now this dread and black complexion smeared
58:38
with heraldry more dismal had to foot now as he total ghouls horridly tricked
58:43
with blood of fathers mothers daughters
58:48
sons baked and and pasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and Damned lead light to the Lords
58:55
murder roasted and wrapped and fire and the source eyes with coagulate gore with

eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you
59:08
well-spoken my lord with good accent and good discretion an omni finds him
59:20
striking too short at Greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where
59:26
it falls repugnant to command unequal matched Pyrrhus at Priam drives me rage
59:33
strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father
59:39
Falls below his sword which was declining on the milky head of Reverend
59:46
Priam seemed the air to stick so as a
59:51
painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood and like a fortune to his will and matter did
59:58
nothing did nothing but after Pyrrhus
1:00:04
pause arouse it vengeance sets him new a-work and never did the Cyclops hammers
1:00:10
fall on Mars his armor forged for proof a turn with less remorse than Pyrrhus
1:00:16
bleeding sword now falls on trying out
1:00:24
out thou strumpet fortune all you gods
1:00:31
in General Synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from a
1:00:38

1:01:31
team at Lloyds of blankets in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with
1:01:41
tongue and venom steep against fortunes state would treason have pronounced for
1:01:47
if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw Pyrrhus make malicious
1:01:52
sport mincing with his sword her husband's limbs the instant burst of
1:02:02
clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have
1:02:10
made noise the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he
1:02:19

1:02:26

1:03:34
to you now I am alone oh what a rogue
1:03:51
and peasant slave am I is it not
1:03:57
monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could
1:04:02
force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visit want
1:04:08
tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect a broken voice and his whole function
1:04:13
suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for Hecuba what's Hecuba to him or he to
1:04:25
Hecuba that he should weep for her what
1:04:31
would he do had he the motive in the cue for passion that I have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the
1:04:38
general ear with horrid speech McNabb guilty appalled the free confound the
1:04:43
ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet I darling
1:04:50
muddy metal rascal pique like Jonah dreams I'm pregnant of my cause and can
1:04:56
say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn
1:05:04
defeat was made a Maya coward
1:05:10
who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it
1:05:16
in my face tricked me by the nose gives me the lie in the throat as deep as to belong who does me this up hmm I should
1:05:23
take it for it can I be but I am kitchen livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this I should have
1:05:30
fattened all the region kites with this slave's awful bloody bawdy villain
1:05:37
morsel Asst treacherous lecherous childless villain vengeance
1:05:48
why what an ass am i this is most brave
1:05:57
that I the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and
1:06:04
hell must like a unpack my heart with words and fall a-cursing like a
1:06:09
very drab a Scullion file full about my brain hmm I have heard that guilty
1:06:24
creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so
1:06:31
to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions for murder
1:06:37
though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ I'll have these players play something like the murder
1:06:44
of my father before mine uncle I'll observe his looks I'll tent him to the quick if I do blench I know my course
1:06:51
the spirit that I have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape
1:06:57
yay and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy is he is very potent with
1:07:03
such spirits abuses me
1:07:12
- damn me I'll have grounds more
1:07:19
relative in this the plays the thing wherein I'll catch
1:07:26
the conscience of the king
1:07:33
[Music]
1:07:50
and can you buy no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this
1:07:55
confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he
1:08:02
feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak did you assay him to any pastime milord
1:08:09
it so fell out that certain players we all wrought along the way of these we told him and there seemed to be in him a
1:08:14
kind of joy to hear of it there about the court and as I believe they have orders this night to play before him tis
1:08:19
most true he did beseech me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it does
1:08:27
much content me to hear him so inclined good gentleman give him a further edge and drive his purpose onto these
1:08:33
delights we shall milord a failure we have closely sent for Hamlet hither that he
1:08:39
has for by accident may here affront you your father and myself lawful as files will so bestow ourselves that seeing
1:08:47
unseen we may of your encounter frankly judge and gather as he is behaved if it
1:08:52
be at the affliction of his love or know that thus he suffers for a failure walk you here read on this book that show of
1:08:59
such an exercise may color your loneliness I hear him coming let's
1:09:05
withdraw milord
1:09:13
to be or not to be that is the question
1:09:20
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of
1:09:30
troubles and by opposing end them to die to Sleep No More and by a sleep to say
1:09:39
we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis
1:09:44
a consummation devoutly to be wish'd to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream
1:09:53
there's the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have
1:10:00
shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would
1:10:08
bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud man's contumely the pangs of despised love the
1:10:15
laws delay the insolence of office the spurns that patient merit of the
1:10:20
unworthy takes when he himself might his Quietus make with a bare bodkin who
1:10:28
would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of
1:10:34
something after death the undiscovered country from whose Bourn no traveler returns puzzles the will and makes us
1:10:42
rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us
1:10:50
all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of
1:10:57
great pitch and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the
1:11:04
name of action soft you now the fair Ophelia
1:11:20
nymph in thy orisons be all my sins
1:11:28
remember'd good milord how does your
1:11:34
honor for this many a day I humbly thank you well well
1:11:49
well my lord I have remembrances of yours that I have longed long to redeliver I pray you now receive them no
1:11:58
not I I never gave you aught milord you know right well you did and with them
1:12:05
words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich their perfume
1:12:11
lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind their milord
1:12:20
huh are you honest milord
1:12:28
are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your
1:12:34
honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty have better commerce than with honesty I truly with
1:12:43
the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
1:12:50
translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time
1:13:01
gives it through I did love you once
1:13:12
indeed you made me believe so should not have believed me for virtue cannot so
1:13:18
inoculate our old stock oh we shall relish of it I loved you not I was the
1:13:23
more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners I
1:13:29
am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse me of such things it were
1:13:36

command a combination and deform indeed where every god it seemed to set his
1:40:40
seal to give the world Assurance of a man this was your husband look you now

1:41:32
turns my eyes into my very soul and there I see such black and grievance spots as will leave there there today

1:41:51
Kings a cut purse of the Empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket a
1:41:58
king of shreds and patches saved me and

2:02:18
criminal and so capital in nature ah for two special reasons which may to you
2:02:24
perhaps see much unseen you'd but yet to me they are strong the Queen his mother
2:02:30
lives almost by his looks and for myself she's so conjunctive to my life and soul
2:02:36
that as the star moves not but in his sphere I could not but by her the other
2:02:41
motive why to a public count I might not go he's the great love the general gender bear him and so have I and noble
2:02:47
father lost a sister driven into desperate times whose worth if praises
2:02:53
may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections
2:02:59
but my revenge will come break not yours
2:03:05
for that you must not think we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can
2:03:10
let our beard be shook with danger and think it past time how now what news
2:03:15
letters my lord from Hamlet from Hamlet this your majesty this to the Queen who
2:03:21
brought them as sailors my lord they say I saw them not you so hear them Laertes leave us high and mighty you shall know
2:03:31
I am set naked on your kingdom tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes when I shall first asking your
2:03:38
pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return Hamlet
2:03:43
what should this mean are all the rest come back or is this some abuse and no such thing no it's his Hamlet's
2:03:50
character and in a postscript here he says alone Laertes will you be ruled by
2:03:57
me I'm a lord so you will not or rule me
2:04:02
to a peace I will work Hamlet to an exploit now ripe in my device under the
2:04:09
which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall
2:04:16
uncharged the practice and call it accident my lord I will be ruled the
2:04:21
rather if you could devise it so that I might be the organ it falls right two
2:04:28
months since here was a man from Normandy who gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your
2:04:35
defence and for your sword most especial that he cried out would be a sight indeed if one could match you sir this
2:04:43
report of his did Hamlet so envenom with his Envy that he could nothing do but wish in beg your sudden coming order to
2:04:49
play with you now out of this once out of this my lord but stay what noises
2:04:54
this one woe doth tread upon another's
2:05:01
heels so fast they follow your sisters
2:05:07
drowned Laertes
2:05:13
drones there is a willow grows aslant a
2:05:24
brook that shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream there with fantastic
2:05:30
Garland's did she make of crow flowers nettles daisies and long purples our
2:05:40
cold maids do dead man's fingers call them there on the pendent boughs her
2:05:47
crown of weeds clamouring to hang an envious sliver broke when down her weedy
2:05:55
trophies and herself fell in the weeping Brook her clothes spread wide and
2:06:06
mermaid-like awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old
2:06:12
tunes as one incapable of her own distress or as a creature native and
2:06:21
indued unto that element but long it could not be till that her garments
2:06:29
heavy with their drink pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy
2:06:35
death
2:06:42
alas when she is drowned drowned drowned
2:07:05
too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia
2:07:11
and therefore I forbid my tears but you
2:07:19
my lord I have a speech that fain would blaze but that this folly drowns it
2:07:29
let's follow Gertrude how much I had to do to calm his rage
2:07:35
now fear I this will give it start again I pray you come with me

[Music]
2:08:12
[Music]
2:08:17
[Music]
2:08:25
[Music]
2:08:33
is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own
2:08:39
salvation I tell thee she is therefore make a grave straight the Khurana
2:08:46
sat on her and finds a Christian burial how can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defense
2:08:52
why just found so God must be say offand endo huh cannot be else here lies the
2:09:02
point if I drown myself wittingly it argues an act an act had three branches
2:09:11
it is to act to do to perform argyll she
2:09:22
drowned herself wittingly nay but here you go leave here lies the
2:09:33
water good he stands de man good now if the man go to this water and
2:09:41
drown himself it is willy-nilly he goes mark it act
2:09:47
but if the water come to him and drown
2:09:53
him he drowns not himself our God he that is not guilty of his own death
2:09:59
shortens not his own life but is this law I merriest crown of quest law got my
2:10:09
space
2:10:14
I'll put a question to thee and if thou answer is not to the purpose confess
2:10:21
thyself go to what is he that builds stronger than the Mason the shipwright
2:10:27

2:10:56
to him to does ill and dial dust ill to say the gallows is built stronger than
2:11:01
to church our goal the gallows may do well to thee stronger and the Mason the
2:11:20
shipwright or the carpet I tell me that none yoke now I can tell to it I cannot
2:11:34

2:11:59
fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at grave making custom hath made it in him a property of easiness to

2:17:18
great command or sways the order she shouldn't ground unsanctified have lodged till the last trumpet for
2:17:26
charitable prayers shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her yet he
2:17:32
or she's allowed her virgin Krantz her made instruments and the bringing home of bell and burial muster no more no
2:17:39
more be done we should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem in
2:17:45
such rest to her as to peace parted souls
2:18:01
lay her in the earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring
2:18:08
I tell the churlish priest a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest
2:18:15
howling what the fair Ophelia sweets to
2:18:31
the sweet farewell I hope thou should have been my
2:18:38
Hamlet's wife I thought thy bride-bed to abduct sweet maid and not have strewed
2:18:46
thy grave
2:18:55
no treble whoa fall ten times trouble upon that cursed head whose wicked deed
2:19:00
thy most ingenious sense deprived me of pulled off the earth awhile till I have
2:19:07
caught her once more in mine arms now piled the dust upon the quick and dead
2:19:12
to love this flat a mountain you have made to our top Olympus what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis whose
2:19:20
phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand like Wonder
2:19:26
wounded heroes this is I Hamlet the day devil take my soul
2:19:32
bring us not well I prithee take thy fingers from my throat away I'm not splitting tip and rat yet have I
2:19:37
something to me dangerous witch let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand lock
2:19:43

2:19:50
thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my son what would thou do for her ah

2:20:31
he may the cat will Mew and dog will have his day pray you good Horatio wait
2:20:38
upon him Laertes was your family dear to
2:20:49
you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart I asked
2:20:54
you this Hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your father's son indeed more
2:21:02
than inwards to cut his throat in the church no place indeed should murder
2:21:08
nice revenge should have no bounds good
2:21:13
Laertes will put on those to praise your excellence with the sword and set a
2:21:19
double varnish on your fame bring you together in a match and wager on your heads and let most generous and free
2:21:29
from all contriving will not peruse the swords so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword
2:21:36
unbated it in a pass of practice requite him for your father i will do it and for
2:21:44
that purpose I'll anoint my sword I bought an unction of a mountebank so
2:21:49
mortal that but dip a knife in it no medicine so rare under the moon can save
2:21:55
the thing from death that is but scratched withal I'll touch my point with this contagion that if I doll him
2:22:01
slightly it may be death will make a solemn wager on the Cunnings and when in
2:22:09
your motion you are hot and dry and that he calls for drink I'll have prepared him a chalice whereon but sipping if he
2:22:15
by chance escape your venom thrust our purpose may hold their strength in your
2:22:24
patience we'll put the matter to the present push this grave shall have a
2:22:29

found her a shoe ah Royal Navy an exact command not to stay the grinding of the
2:24:10
ax my head should be struck off it's possible I sat me down devised a new
2:24:15
commission wrote it fair and earnest conjuration from the king that on the view and knowing of these contents he
2:24:20
should the bearers put to sudden death not striving time aloud how was this
2:24:27
sealed what even and that was heaven ordinance I had my father's signet in my purse which was the model of that Danish
2:24:33
seal folded the writ up in form of the other subscribe to gape the impression placed it safely The Changeling never
2:24:41
known so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern go

2:25:05
angle for my proper life and we had such cousin Ajit's not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and it's not to

2:37:25
and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook fallen on the inventors
2:37:31
heads all this can I truly deliver and let us haste to hear it and call the

2:37:44
rights of memory in this kingdom which now to claim my Vantage Duff invite me [Music]
